  "outcome": "COMPLETED",
  "summary": "Added all missing slash commands for Ralph sub-commands (hooks-install/uninstall, opencode-install/uninstall, watch, view-diff, notifications, terminal) and run:select. Updated /help output to show commands grouped by category (Core, Views, Ralph, Settings, System). Added short aliases (/watch, /diff, /select). Updated CLI input placeholder to '/ command  ·  Ctrl+P for palette'. Extended local_router.py to handle two-word forms like 'ralph hooks install'. Added tests for slash command map, aliases, help output, placeholder, and autocomplete suggestions.",
