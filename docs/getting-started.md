# Getting Started

1. Install `agent-recall`.
2. Run `agent-recall init` in a repository.
3. Run `agent-recall tui` (or `agent-recall config setup`) to complete onboarding for that repo, including live provider model selection and generation tuning (`temperature`, `max_tokens`).
4. While in the TUI, use `Ctrl+P` for command search/execution and `Ctrl+,` for settings.
5. Start a session with `agent-recall start "task"`.
6. Log observations with `agent-recall log`.
7. End the session and compact knowledge with `agent-recall end` then `agent-recall compact`.
