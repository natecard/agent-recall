# Agent Recall Ralph Progress Log
# Append-only: each iteration adds a new timestamped entry.
2026-02-12T16:30:58Z | Iteration 1 | AR-001 | Tracer-bullet shipped: Codex source discovery/parsing (CODEX_HOME + ~/.codex, json/jsonl, tool calls) with registry/docs/tests; validation green.
2026-02-12T16:41:27Z | Iteration 1 | AR-001 | Parser hardening: support Codex custom_tool_call/custom_tool_call_output with call_id matching plus regression tests; validation green.
2026-02-12T17:17:09Z | Iteration 1 | AR-002 | Implemented checkpoint persistence (SessionCheckpoint model, SQLite storage methods, tests); validation green.
2026-02-12T17:33:00Z | Iteration 2 | AR-002 | Integrated checkpoints into sync flow: incremental message filtering, content hash change detection, checkpoint updates after processing, reset options (reset_checkpoints/reset_full); validation green.
2026-02-12T20:15:00Z | Iteration 3 | AR-005 | Created fixture corpus (11 files: JSON/JSONL variants, malformed cases, edge cases) and added 21 comprehensive tests; parser handles edge cases gracefully; validation green.
2026-02-12T20:30:00Z | Iteration 4 | AR-008 | Production readiness: finalized package metadata (author, URLs, classifiers), created CHANGELOG.md with versioning policy, added compatibility matrices to README.md, created GitHub Actions CI workflow for Python 3.11/3.12/3.13 on Ubuntu/macOS; validation green.
2026-02-12T21:30:00Z | Iteration 1 | AR-006 | Implemented background sync mode with file-based locking (BackgroundSyncManager), status persistence in SQLite, new `sync-background` CLI command, updated `status` command to show background sync state; validation green.
2026-02-12T20:43:49Z | Iteration 1 | AR-006 | Added `refresh-context` command to write `.agent/context/context.md` + `.agent/context/context.json` using active-session task fallback; added CLI coverage; validation green.
2026-02-12T20:51:11Z | Iteration 2 | AR-006 | Added bounded retries + clear diagnostics for sync-background + refresh-context, fixed lock acquisition in run_sync, added retry-path tests; validation green.
2026-02-12T20:59:22Z | Iteration 1 | AR-003 | Completed tracer-bullet step 1: optional deterministic embedding generation during compaction with SQLite embedding persistence + retrieval round-trip tests; validation green.
2026-02-12T21:04:50Z | Iteration 2 | AR-003 | Implemented hybrid retrieval rank fusion (FTS + vector similarity) with deterministic tie-breaking and regression tests; validation green.
2026-02-12T21:10:09Z | Iteration 1 | AR-003 | Added optional retrieval reranking stage (default off) with deterministic scoring/tie-breaks and focused regression tests; validation green.
2026-02-12T21:17:57Z | Iteration 2 | AR-003 | Exposed retrieval backend/tuning via config + CLI: context/start/refresh-context/retrieve now build Retriever from retrieval config (backend, top_k, fusion_k, rerank, rerank_candidate_k) with CLI overrides for context/retrieve; added regression tests; validation green.
2026-02-12T21:25:25Z | Iteration 1 | AR-004 | Defined non-style indexing policy (decision/exploration enabled, narrative disabled), wired compaction chunk indexing to that policy, and added regression coverage; validation green.
2026-02-12T21:30:45Z | Iteration 2 | AR-004 | Added configurable non-style indexing confidence thresholds (decision/exploration/narrative), filtered low-confidence noise during chunk indexing, updated config defaults/init template, and added regression coverage; validation green.
