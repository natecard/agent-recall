      "description": "Currently, there are two clocks visible in the TUI: one in the top header (with 'AgentRecallTextualApp') and one in the dashboard (with 'Updated timestamp'). We need to simplify this to a single, clean clock display.",
      "requirements": [
        "Remove the 'AgentRecallTextualApp' header branding and its associated clock.",
